# MVC Deviation Log

> **Note on placeholder state at registration.** Empty / placeholder entries at registration time are expected by design. The log accumulates real entries only when registered deviations or §7.4 execution-fixes occur post-registration; the registration-time state is therefore a scaffold with explanatory headings and an empty entry table.

**Pre-registration:** Does AI Detect Moral Violations or Construct Them? — Persona-Driven Classification Bias in Large Language Models (OSF: 00_OSF_Pre_Registration.pdf). Tests the Motivated Violation Construction (MVC) framework (Boullineau, 2026, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.19423437).
**Status at registration:** *empty — no deviations recorded.*
**Maintainer:** Research Associate (José Daniel Muñoz Arciniegas), under PI direction.
**Authority:** Pre-registration §7.4 (Deviation Log).
**Scaffold version:** v1.0 — May 2026 (empty at registration; append-only deviation entries to be logged in execution order during data collection).

## Purpose

This file is the canonical, append-only registry of every deviation from the pre-registered protocol. Every entry made during the study lifecycle (pre-test → main collection → semantic-null run → robustness/stability checks → narrative coding → analysis) must be added here. Deviations are reported in the final manuscript under a dedicated "Deviations from Pre-Registration" section, citing this log.

## What gets logged here

Per pre-reg §7.4, log:

- API timeouts, rate-limit retries, individual cell re-runs
- Data loss affecting fewer than 5% of total trials within any single model (minor)
- Semantic-null reserve-bank substitutions (the swap and its rationale, per §2.3)
- Model version-string changes detected mid-collection (§3.3)
- Behavioural-drift triggers exceeding 2 SD from the running mean (§3.3)
- Anchor-trial deviations exceeding 1.5 SD from the Day-1 baseline (§3.3)
- Daily-anchor pause events
- Stan retry events (registered automatic retry with `adapt_delta=0.999`, `max_treedepth=18`; per §7.4 this is *not* a deviation, but the retry event itself is logged here with before/after diagnostic counts for transparency)
- Coding-prompt revision cycles (sanity-check failures, §5.4.5)
- Calibration-failure re-attempts and replacements (PI/RA or Auditor; §5.4.2 / §5.4.8)
- Attention-check failures (§5.4.3)
- Any accidental mid-stream code-derived feedback during Phase 1 (registered absence: §5.4.6 — no midpoint κ check, no midpoint drift check, no mid-stream reliability statistic is part of the design).
- Manual coding portal fallback to spreadsheet (§7.4 manual coding contingency)
- Functional code corrections that fall under the bug-fix clause (§7.4); each entry must record the magnitude (≤ 1% absolute change on any reported posterior, p-value, point estimate, or credible/confidence-interval bound) and the diff reference (Git commit hash)
- Auditor withdrawal / replacement events (§5.4.8)

Per pre-reg §7.4 **major** deviations require a formal OSF amendment **before** analysis proceeds; major deviations include:

- Excluding a model (other than under the registered stability-check criterion §3.3)
- Stability-check-driven model exclusion
- Changing persona definitions
- Altering the ambiguity threshold
- Data loss exceeding 5% of total trials within any single model
- Any change to pre-registered predictions, failure conditions, or primary statistical specifications

Each major deviation logged here must reference the corresponding OSF amendment ID and link.

## Entry format

```
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC — [MINOR | MAJOR | NOT-A-DEVIATION (§7.4 bug-fix clause)]

**Entry ID (required, format `DEV-YYYY-NNN` or `DEV-YYYY-<TAG>`):** [Unique identifier — mandatory. Consumed by `05a_Resume_Statistical_Analysis.R --accept-deviation-log-entry=<entry_id>` for certified post-fix resume runs (pre-reg §7.5).]

**Commit SHA (this entry):** [Git commit SHA for the commit that records THIS entry — added before the entry is signed off]

**Category:** [API outage / version drift / Stan retry / coding revision / calibration / attention check / portal fallback / functional bug fix / other]

**Affected scope:** [models / scenarios / personas / sub-cells / trials / coders / dimensions]

**What happened:**
[Plain-language description.]

**Justification:**
[Why this deviation was necessary; reference pre-reg section.]

**Impact assessment:**
[Effect on the affected analysis or trial subset; how the affected data are handled downstream; whether the deviation crosses the 1% magnitude boundary in §7.4.]

**Action taken:**
[Concrete steps: re-run, exclude, retain with caveat, file OSF amendment ID, etc.]

**Audit trail anchors:**
[Trial IDs, checkpoint paths, Git commit hash, OSF amendment URL, etc.]

**Post-fix SHA-256 (registered §7.4 bug-fix only):**
- File: `<filename>` (e.g., `05_Statistical_Analysis.R`)
- Post-fix SHA-256: `<64-hex>`
- Pre-fix SHA-256 (for the record): `<64-hex>`
- Magnitude check (before/after_summary.csv path): `<path>`

## Entries

*No entries at registration. New entries are appended below in reverse-chronological order (newest first) once the study lifecycle begins.*

### Worked example (illustrative — not a real deviation)

````
### 2026-MM-DD HH:MM UTC — NOT-A-DEVIATION (§7.4 bug-fix clause)

**Commit SHA (this entry):** (EXAMPLE)

**Category:** functional bug fix

**Affected scope:** `05_Statistical_Analysis.R` Phase P2 specification block

**What happened:**
A functional bug was identified in `05_Statistical_Analysis.R` (illustrative — example only). Fix applied under the §7.4 bug-fix clause.

**Justification:**
Bug-fix clause (§7.4): functional correction that does not alter pre-registered predictions, failure conditions, or primary statistical specifications. Magnitude check confirms ≤ 1% absolute change on all reported quantities.

**Impact assessment:**
See `before/after_summary.csv` (path under "Audit trail anchors"). All reported posteriors, p-values, point estimates, and CI bounds change by ≤ 1% absolute.

**Action taken:**
Bug fix committed; resumed analysis from `after_p1` using the certified-resume path:

```
Rscript 05_Statistical_Analysis.R \
  --resume-from after_p1 \
  --checkpoint-dir results/checkpoints_certified_DEV-2026-EXAMPLE-001 \
  --accept-deviation-log-entry=DEV-2026-EXAMPLE-001
```

**Audit trail anchors:**
Trial IDs: N/A. Checkpoint path: `results/checkpoints_certified_DEV-2026-EXAMPLE-001/`. Git commit hash: (EXAMPLE). OSF amendment URL: N/A (minor — bug-fix clause, no amendment required).

**Post-fix SHA-256 (registered §7.4 bug-fix only):**
- File: `05_Statistical_Analysis.R`
- Post-fix SHA-256: `(EXAMPLE)`
- Pre-fix SHA-256 (for the record): `(EXAMPLE)`
- Magnitude check (before/after_summary.csv path): `results/diagnostics/before_after_summary_DEV-2026-EXAMPLE-001.csv`

**Entry ID:** DEV-2026-EXAMPLE-001

## Milestone SHA-256 Deposit Schedule (registered, pre-reg §7.4)

A running SHA-256 of this `MVC_Deviation_Log.md` is computed and OSF-deposited at four registered milestones:

| Milestone | Trigger | Deposited SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-test lock | Pre-test data collection complete and signed off | _(placeholder — recorded at trigger)_ |
| Main-collection start | First main-study API call made | _(placeholder)_ |
| Coding lock | Both PI and RA Submit Final | _(placeholder)_ |
| Analysis lock | Canonical Level-4 run start | _(placeholder)_ |

Each deposit carries an OSF timestamp. Reviewers can independently audit the log's state at each milestone against these deposited hashes.

---

*This log is co-registered with all other registration package materials. It is **not** Appendix-D-locked because it is an append-only operational record whose post-registration mutations are the entries themselves; instead its state IS recorded at the four registered milestones above (pre-test lock, main-collection start, coding lock, analysis lock), each carrying an OSF-deposited SHA-256 and timestamp so reviewers can independently audit the log's state at each milestone.*
